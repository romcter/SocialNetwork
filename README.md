In this project I am working with Spring and Hibernate framework. You can create a user by registering (spring security) on the website or logging in through a google account (oauth2 spring), the password is recovered through messages to the mail (spring mail).
I tried to implement a mini social network where you can communicate with other people (WebSocket), start your own personal page with audio, video, pictures and friends (you can also upload your content using MultipartFile). On the admin page, you can block other users and unblock.
